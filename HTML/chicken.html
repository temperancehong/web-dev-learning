    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red
        junglefowl</a> of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
        others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.
